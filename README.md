# About

In today's fast-paced digital world, website performance plays a crucial role in delivering a seamless user experience. A slow-loading website can lead to frustrated users and increased bounce rates. To address this issue, developers often use compression techniques to reduce the size of data transported between the server and the client. One such technique is GZIP compression.

In this project, we'll explore how to implement GZIP compression in a Spring Boot application to improve performance and enhance user satisfaction.

## Why Compression?

Let's consider a use case where you have a client and a server. The server is your Spring Boot backend app. When the client sends a request to get a list of employee objects, the server might respond with a large payload, say 100 MB. Transferring this large amount of data over the network can increase latency and bandwidth usage.

Instead, if we compress the response to a smaller size, say 10 MB, and send it over the network, the client can decompress it back to the original data size. This reduces network latency and bandwidth usage.

## Implementing GZIP Compression

GZIP compression is widely used in the industry and offers seamless integration with Spring Boot. Here's how you can enable it:

1. **Add Configuration in `application.properties`**:
    ```properties
    server.compression.enabled=true
    server.compression.mime-types=application/json,application/xml,text/html,text/xml,text/plain
    server.compression.min-response-size=1024
    ```

2. **Test the Application**:
    - Without GZIP: Measure the response time and data size.
    - With GZIP: Measure the response time and data size again.

### Validation

You can validate the compression by inspecting the response headers in your browser or Postman. Look for the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header.

## Conclusion

Enabling GZIP compression in your Spring Boot application can significantly improve performance by reducing the size of data transferred over the network. This tutorial demonstrated how to enable GZIP compression and measure its impact on response time and data size.
